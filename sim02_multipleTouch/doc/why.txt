OVERALL GOAL: a simplified model for counting.
build a model that touches every items in the environment (professor McClelland's suggestion)

WHAT I DID: a model that touches multiple objects in the world. When the model touches all items, the game ends. 


SOME OBSERVATIONS: 
where there are 5 spots and 3 items, the model easily learnt to touch every spot once. 
When there are 7 spots, the model can still learn that strategy, but it needs much more time. 

PROBLEM: 
The model needs vision: the current model is blind

It doesn’t make sense to touch empty spots
But I can’t simply assign 0 prob to empty spots, because…  
those empty spots still should matters, although I don’t know how… 

TRY: 
implement vision into the model’s state, so it can perceive it.
