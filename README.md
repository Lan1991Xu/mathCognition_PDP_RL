# pdp approach to matematical cognition
For the summer research project at Stanford CSLI,
 supervised by Professor Jay McClelland.

There is an RL driven model for a couting sub-task. Given a sequence of objects (<=7), placed on a one-dimensional line, the model learns to touch everything exactly once from left to right. The following figures display the model's architecture and its performance under different training regime.
