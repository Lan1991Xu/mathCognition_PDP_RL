OVERALL GOAL: 


WHAT I DID: 


SOME OBSERVATIONS:
1. just set the mid rwd == 0 has the same effect, so the code can be simplified
2. recording the weights along the training, so plotting the learning curve is very flexible
3. initial location was U[2,5], and now it is U[1,5], which is consistent with the current spacing policy. the results was replicated quite successfully



PROBLEM:
